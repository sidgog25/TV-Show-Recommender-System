# TV-Show-Recommender-System
Created in Fall 2022. Built a content based recommendation system for TV shows that recommends the top 5 TV shows to watch based on the one you chose. 

Basic Description

Used dataset from Kaggle that contained 3000 TV shows with information on cast, description, IMDB rating etc. Used given data to create tags and used vectorization along with cosine similarity to accurately pull the 5 most similar shows to the one you chose. Built a webpage using Pucharm and deployed the model onto it so once you select the TV show of your choise and click the Recommend button the webpage would spit out your top 5 similar shows along with their IMDB ratings and a short description.
